## Introduction

CloudWeGo is Golang-centric middleware that can be used to quickly build enterprise-class cloud native architectures. 
It contains many components, including the RPC framework Kitex, the basic network library Netpoll, thrfitgo, and netpoll-http2. 
By combining the community's excellent open source products, developers can quickly build a complete set of micro-service systems.

And, we can always use more testing, have more and improved docs, or just write a blog post on what you have discovered while using CloudWeGo.
